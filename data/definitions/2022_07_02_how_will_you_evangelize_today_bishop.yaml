original_title: How Will You Evangelize Today? - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Jak dziś ewangelizujesz? - Niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, as we continue now our reading of the Gospel of Luke,
  we have today a great portrait of the Church—what the Church looks like, what its
  central concerns are, and what the demands upon it are. The setting is Jesus sending
  out seventy-two disciples. Put yourself in that position: all of us baptized people
  are disciples of the Lord, and we''re in a relationship with him. He is sending
  us out on mission.SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel to watch every Sunday Sermon:
