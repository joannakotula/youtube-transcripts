original_title: Give as God Gives - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Daj, jak Bóg daje - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, whenever we give or receive a gift, we''re always
  caught in a difficult rhythm of exchange and mutual obligation. The great exception
  to this rule is God, who is utterly gratuitous in his giving. But in Luke’s Sermon
  on the Plain, we are invited to share, by grace, in the very way that God exists
  and that God loves, giving to those in need without expecting anything in return.SUBSCRIBE
