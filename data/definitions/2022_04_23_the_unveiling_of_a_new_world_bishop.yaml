original_title: The Unveiling of a New World - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Odsłonięcie nowego świata - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, Revelation comes from the Latin “Revelatio,” which
  in turn translates the Greek “Apokalypsis”—which means, literally, “unveiling.”
  This final book of the Bible, which has fascinated Christians and non-Christians
  for two thousand years, is not primarily about the end of the physical world; rather,
  it is meant to unveil something that every generation of Christians needs to see—namely,
  a new world that God wants to be born out of the ruins of the old.SUBSCRIBE to my
