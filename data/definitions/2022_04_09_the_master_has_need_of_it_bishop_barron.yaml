original_title: The Master Has Need of It - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Mistrz tego potrzebuje - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'In the Palm Sunday Gospel reading proclaimed before the procession,
  the Lord instructs two of his disciples to go into the village and untether a donkey.
  If there is any protest, they are to say, “The Master has need of it.” This is true
  of every baptized person: the Master has need of your gifts, of you, of the whole
  of your life. Once we understand this principle, everything is revolutionized—and
  we are liberated to be of service to Christ and his people.SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube
