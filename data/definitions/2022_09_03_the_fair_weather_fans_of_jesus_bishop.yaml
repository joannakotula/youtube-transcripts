original_title: The Fair-Weather Fans of Jesus - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Fani Jezusa - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, there are a lot of people today who might be intrigued
  by Jesus. They find him interesting, remember him as a spiritual teacher, or have
  warm feelings about him. But in today’s Gospel, Jesus is saying to his fair-weather
  fans—those who are following him because he’s fascinating and charismatic—that being
  his disciple is not a walk in the park; it is something of supreme spiritual and
  moral importance.SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel to watch every Sunday Sermon: https://bit.ly/wof-subscribe———VIDEO
