original_title: Greater than the Greatest of All Time — Bishop Barron’s Sunday Sermon
title: Większe niż największe wszechczasów - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, Moses is, without a doubt, the greatest figure in
  the Old Testament. He heard the voice of God from the burning bush; he was chosen
  to lead the people Israel to freedom; he was given the Ten Commandments; he was
  permitted to speak with God as a friend. Every teacher within ancient Judaism derived
  his authority finally from Moses. Therefore, when Moses speaks of a prophet who
  is to come, who is “like himself,” and who should be listened to—apparently of even
  greater authority than Moses—Israel took heed.Jesus is the prophet whom Moses predicted
  would come. But who, finally, could have the authority to speak the divine Word
  and bring healing to creation? It could only be God himself.Watch the Spanish version:
