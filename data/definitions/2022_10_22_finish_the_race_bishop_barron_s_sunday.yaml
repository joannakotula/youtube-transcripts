original_title: Finish the Race - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Zakończ wyścig - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, our second reading this week is from Paul’s Second
  Letter to Timothy—one of the last letters we have from St. Paul. Now toward the
  end of his life, Paul passes on various pieces of wisdom to his young friend, including
  this: “I have finished the race.” The spiritual life is like a race; it includes
  different stages, from the promise, energy, and enthusiasm of the beginning to the
  experience of hitting the wall, where you can’t go on. St. Paul experienced all
  of those stages, and his hugely inspiring words are for all of us: no matter where
  you are in the race, finish it.SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel to watch every Sunday
