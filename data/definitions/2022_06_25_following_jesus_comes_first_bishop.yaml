original_title: Following Jesus Comes First - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Kazanie biskupa Barrona Biskupa Barrona - niedzielne kazanie
original_description: 'Friends, I’m going to be blunt with you: today’s Gospel is
  really challenging. It cuts right to the heart of the ethical implications of the
  Gospel. There''s something of a “be all, end all” quality about Jesus, something
  of an either/or. As he says, “Whoever is not with me is against me.” What follows
  from this is what I call the principle of detachment and clarification of motives.
  If Jesus is unambiguously the center of your life, then everything else has to find
  its place in relation to him. If the good things of the world become more important
  than following him, then something has gone off-kilter.SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel
