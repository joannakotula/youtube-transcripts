original_title: Three Lessons of the Resurrection - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Trzy lekcje zmartwychwstania - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, a very blessed and happy Easter to you all! The Resurrection
  of Jesus is the be-all and the end-all of the Christian faith. If Jesus didn''t
  rise from the dead, then all bishops, priests, and Christian ministers should go
  home and get honest jobs. If he did rise from the dead, then he''s the full manifestation
  of God, and he must be the center of your life. In light of that, I''d like to look
  at three great lessons that follow from this strange and decisive truth of the Resurrection.SUBSCRIBE
