  to you.In today’s victorious and triumphant Gospel, we hear the fanfares announce
  in the most unambiguous way that God, the sworn enemy of death, has overcome the
  powers of sin through his sovereignty: Jesus has risen from the dead.As we rejoice
  with Christ, we are asked to share the Good News of Easter:- Jesus is Lord of all
  things—even sin and death- Jesus’ claims about himself are indubitably proven and
  ratified- God’s love is more powerful than anything in the worldWatch the Spanish
