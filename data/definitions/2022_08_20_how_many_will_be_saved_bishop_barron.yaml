original_title: How Many Will Be Saved? - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Ile zostanie uratowanych? - Niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, I am admittedly a bit reluctant to talk about the
  topic of our Gospel for today—namely, this famously controversial matter of how
  many will be saved. I have talked a lot and written a lot about this issue, and
  people have very strong opinions about it: everybody will be saved, only a handful
  will be saved, and everything in between. There is a lot of energy around this question.
  In this homily, I would like to get at the question in a new and fresh way by looking
  at Jesus’ answer in the Gospel.If you have further questions about heaven, hell,
  and the hope that all will be saved, please read this resource page: https://www.wordonfire.org/hope/Make
