original_title: Act Against Your Attachments - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Działaj przeciwko swoim załączom - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, at the heart of what St. Ignatius of Loyola teaches
  in the “Spiritual Exercises” is the idea of detachment. If we are to do the will
  of God, then we have to become detached from the worldly goods to which we are addicted.
  A basic principle of this detachment is “agere contra,” which is Latin simply for
  “to act against.” The idea is simple: if you are attached or addicted to some worldly
  good, then the best thing is to act against it—to press, aggressively even, in the
  opposite direction.SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel to watch every Sunday Sermon:
