original_title: Have You Stopped Listening to Jesus? — Bishop Barron’s Sunday Sermon
title: Czy przestałeś słuchać Jezusa? - Niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, in today’s Gospel, Jesus travels outside of Israel
  and heals a man of his deafness. Today, we live in a realm of spiritual deafness.
  We are bombarded with voices from outside, echoing around us until we are as incapable
  of hearing as the man from our Gospel. Like him, look to Jesus to heal you so that
  you might hear the word of God and understand his truth, rather than the lies of
  the world which surround us.SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel to watch every Sunday
