original_title: The Great Army of the Martyrs - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Wielka armia męczenników - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, during this Easter season we''re reading from the
  book of Revelation, that marvelous, final book of the Bible. In today''s reading,
  John sees mystically, across space and time, across the Christian centuries, all
  those people from all over the world who would give their lives for Christ. This
  army of martyrs compels a choice: Which army do we fight with? The army of the world,
  or the army of the Lamb, standing as though slain?SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel
