original_title: How Are You Caring for the Poor? - Bishop Barron's Sunday Sermon
title: Jak troszczysz się o biednych? - niedzielne kazanie biskupa Barrona
original_description: 'Friends, Pope Benedict XVI memorably said that the Church does
  three essential things: it evangelizes, it worships God, and it cares for the poor.
  This week, the words of Amos the prophet and Jesus’ parable of Lazarus and the rich
  man are meant to put us on the hook when it comes to the third task. How much do
  we care for those who are poor? Are we living lives of self-preoccupation and self-indulgence
  while our own brothers and sisters are suffering and starving at our gate?SUBSCRIBE
